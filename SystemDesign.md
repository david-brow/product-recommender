# High-Level System Design for eCommerce Personalization Engine

This document provides a high-level system design for scaling the personalization engine to handle **millions of users and products**.

---

## **Architecture Components**

1. **Ingestion Layer**  
   - Real-time updates from product information, customer feedback, and marketing campaign APIs.
2. **Data Storage**  
   - SQL databases optimized for different types of data.
3. **Processing Layer**  
   - Microservices to process data and generate recommendations.
4. **Caching Layer**  
   - Redis or Memcached for low-latency access.
5. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - AI-based model to generate personalized recommendations.
6. **API Gateway**  
   - Exposes endpoints to serve product data and recommendations.
7. **Monitoring & Alerting**  
   - Observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog.

## **1. Real-Time Data Pipeline Design**

- **Ingestion Layer**: Use **Kafka** to manage real-time streams from APIs.
- **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Sync product and campaign data through Kafka to reflect updates instantly.
- **Microservices for Data Enrichment**: Process data to combine product information, feedback, and campaigns.

**Reason**: Kafka ensures **durability** and **scalability** for high-throughput data ingestion.

---

## **2. Database Choices**

- **PostgreSQL** for Product Catalog and Feedback:  
   - **Reason**: Relational structure with efficient queries for product data and customer feedback.
- **Redis** for Recommendations Cache:  
   - **Reason**: In-memory caching for fast access to recommendations.

---

## **3. Ensuring Low Latency**

1. **Precompute Recommendations**: Batch jobs to generate recommendations for frequent users in advance.
2. **Caching Layer**: Use **Redis** to store precomputed recommendations and serve them quickly.
3. **Load Balancing**: Use **Nginx** to distribute traffic across multiple API instances.

**Reason**: Precomputed recommendations and caching minimize response times under peak loads.

---

## **4. A/B Testing Implementation**

- **Feature Flags**: Enable/disable different recommendation algorithms without redeployment.
- **User Segments**: Split traffic dynamically:
  - **Group A**: Recommendation Algorithm 1  
  - **Group B**: Recommendation Algorithm 2
- Store A/B test results in a **PostgreSQL analytics table** for tracking performance.

**Reason**: Feature flags enable dynamic algorithm switching and experimentation.

---

## **5. Monitoring and Alerting Systems**

- **Prometheus**: Collect metrics (API response times, Kafka consumer lag, Redis usage).
- **Grafana**: Visualize metrics with dashboards.
- **Datadog**: Alerts for key events (high latency, service unavailability, cache misses).
- **Sentry**: Track application errors.

**Reason**: Monitoring ensures proactive resolution of issues and system reliability.

---

## **Summary**

This system design ensures **scalability, low latency, and reliability** by:
- **Kafka** for real-time ingestion and data synchronization.
- **PostgreSQL** for structured product and feedback data.
- **Redis** for fast access to recommendations.
- **A/B testing** to optimize recommendation algorithms.
- **Monitoring** with Prometheus, Grafana, and Datadog to ensure smooth operations.

This architecture efficiently handles **millions of users and products** while providing personalized recommendations, even during peak traffic.
